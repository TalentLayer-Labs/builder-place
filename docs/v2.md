## TODO

- [ ] create-platform > have custom domain auto generated based on name (like handle)
- [ ] configure-platform > what is tempFormValues?
- [ ] clean workfer profile in talentLayer context
- [ ] update the button "manage gasless". We need to have more info on what step is missing (email validation ? delegate ?)
- [ ] update update profile form, have same field in db, and use the form to update the db and onchain

- [ ] use graph official on mainnet


## MEP Process

- [ ] Prepare delegate wallet with funds (at least 100 matic), and update env params
- [ ] Add the MINT_ROLE to the address executing the delegation actions for minting TL platforms for address
- [ ] Onbaording Platorm. 2 options: pass mint in public without delegate + add mint fee OR use delegate mint + add delegate wallet with MINT ROLE
- [ ] All ETH addresses in DB must be in caps
- [ ] reactive cron for emails for new jobs, proposals ect..

## Fees management

- the platform ID in the .env will be used as the proposal platform source
    - used in createProposal
    - will earn the originValidatedProposalFeeRate from each transaction
- the platform ID of the current domain BuilderPlace will be used as the service source
    - used in createService
    - will earn the originServiceFeeRate from each transaction
