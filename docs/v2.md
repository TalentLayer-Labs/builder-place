## MEP Process

- [ ] Prepare delegate wallet with funds (at least 100 matic), and update env params
- [ ] Add the MINT_ROLE to the address executing the delegation actions for minting TL platforms for address
- [ ] Onbaording Platorm. 2 options: pass mint in public without delegate + add mint fee OR use delegate mint + add delegate wallet with MINT ROLE
- [ ] All ETH addresses in DB must be in caps

## Fees management

- the platform ID in the .env will be used as the proposal platform source
    - used in createProposal
    - will earn the originValidatedProposalFeeRate from each transaction
- the platform ID of the current domain BuilderPlace will be used as the service source
    - used in createService
    - will earn the originServiceFeeRate from each transaction
